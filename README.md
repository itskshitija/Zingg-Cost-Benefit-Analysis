## üîçProject Overview
The Cold Drink Station is a beverage company that sells cold drinks under the brand name 'Zingg'. For the upcoming summer season, they aim to appeal to young customers in India by marketing their brand during the World Cup. The marketing head is very excited about the brand launch, but the finance manager is a bit skeptical and has requested a cost-benefit report for the event. 

As a data analyst in the marketing department, you have been asked to prepare a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and present it through a dashboard to the marketing head.

The marketing team has decided to introduce a new bottle for Zingg, featuring World Cup-related images. This initiative will incur additional costs for a new mould and higher packaging expenses. The new bottle will replace the regular Zingg bottles for six months.

## üöÄObjective
- **Assess the financial impact of the new marketing campaign.**
- **Compare the costs and revenue projections under the old and new plans.**
- **Identify the profitability of the new initiative over the six months.**
- **Provide actionable insights and recommendations to the marketing team.**

## üìúRequirements Gathering and Documentation
As a business analyst, the first step would be to gather all the requirements necessary for the analysis and document it. Documentation is the most critical part of project development as it is the foundation of all further project deliverables describing what inputs and outputs are associated with each process function.

### I have created a Business Requirement documentation for our business case [Here](https://github.com/itskshitija/Zingg-Cost-Benefit-Analysis/blob/main/Zingg-CostBenefitAnalysis_BRD.pdf)

## üìäExploratory Data Analysis

### Sales Units (in '000')
This table represents the expected number of Zingg bottles sold per month under two different plans:
- **Old Plan:** The company originally expected sales to start at 725,000 units in March, increasing by 5% month-over-month.
- **New Plan:** With the new marketing strategy (World Cup-themed bottles), sales are projected to start higher at 800,000 units in March, increasing by 10% month-over-month.

| Month     | March | April | May  | June | July | August |
|-----------|-------|-------|------|------|------|--------|
| **Old Plan** | 725   | 762   | 801  | 842  | 885  | 930    |
| **New Plan** | 800   | 880   | 968  | 1065 | 1172 | 1290   |

- Under the old plan, sales would have grown steadily, reaching 930,000 units in August.
- Under the new plan, sales growth is significantly higher, reaching 1.29 million units in August due to increased demand driven by marketing efforts.

### Price per Unit (‚Çπ)
This table shows that the selling price of each Zingg bottle remains constant at ‚Çπ82 per bottle, regardless of the sales plan.
| Month     | March | April | May  | June | July | August |
|-----------|-------|-------|------|------|------|--------|
| **Old Plan** | 82    | 82    | 82   | 82   | 82   | 82     |
| **New Plan** | 82    | 82    | 82   | 82   | 82   | 82     |

- The price per unit remains unchanged, meaning revenue growth will be entirely driven by increased sales volume, not by price adjustments.

### Per Unit Material Consumption (in ml)
