## üîçProject Overview
The Cold Drink Station is a beverage company that sells cold drinks under the brand name 'Zingg'. For the upcoming summer season, they aim to appeal to young customers in India by marketing their brand during the World Cup. The marketing head is very excited about the brand launch, but the finance manager is a bit skeptical and has requested a cost-benefit report for the event. 

As a data analyst in the marketing department, you have been asked to prepare a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and present it through a dashboard to the marketing head.

The marketing team has decided to introduce a new bottle for Zingg, featuring World Cup-related images. This initiative will incur additional costs for a new mold and higher packaging expenses. The new bottle will replace the regular Zingg bottles for six months.

## üöÄObjective
- **Assess the financial impact of the new marketing campaign.**
- **Compare the costs and revenue projections under the old and new plans.**
- **Identify the profitability of the new initiative over the six months.**
- **Provide actionable insights and recommendations to the marketing team.**

## üìúRequirements Gathering and Documentation
As a business analyst, the first step would be to gather all the requirements necessary for the analysis and document it. Documentation is the most critical part of project development as it is the foundation of all further project deliverables describing what inputs and outputs are associated with each process function.

### üìÑI have created a Business Requirement documentation for our business case [Here](https://github.com/itskshitija/Zingg-Cost-Benefit-Analysis/blob/main/Zingg-CostBenefitAnalysis_BRD.pdf)

| Coloring Agents| 500                   | 0.50%      |

Based on the composition table, the cold drink consists of:  
- **85% Water**  
- **10% Sugar Syrup**  
- **2% Flavoring**  
- **2% Carbonated Water**  
- **0.50% Preservatives**  
- **0.50% Coloring Agents**  

#### Material Consumption per Bottle (in ml) Calculation  
To determine the material consumption per bottle, we apply the given percentage composition to the total bottle volume.  

For eg. In March Month, Material Consumption per Bottle (in ml) = 1000 * 85% = 850

| Month            | March | April | May  | June | July | August |
|-----------------|-------|-------|------|------|------|--------|
| **Water**       | 850   | 850   | 850  | 850  | 850  | 850    |
| **Sugar Syrup** | 100   | 100   | 100  | 100  | 100  | 100    |
| **Flavoring**   | 20    | 20    | 20   | 20   | 20   | 20     |
| **Carbonated Water** | 20 | 20  | 20   | 20   | 20   | 20     |
| **Preservatives** | 5   | 5     | 5    | 5    | 5    | 5      |
| **Coloring Agents** | 5  | 5     | 5    | 5    | 5    | 5      |

The following table represents the quantity of each raw material consumed in thousand litres for the Old Plan over six months.
| Month             | March  | April  | May    | June   | July   | August |
|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|

| **Coloring Agents** | 4  | 4.4   | 4.84  | 5.325 | 5.86  | 6.45   |

- The new plan results in a higher consumption of all raw materials.
- This is expected due to the increase in sales quantity in the new plan (from 725,000 units in March to 800,000 units and growing at a higher rate).
- The new plan aims for higher sales growth, leading to increased raw material consumption. While this can drive higher revenue, it also increases material costs, requiring careful cost management and supply chain efficiency. üöÄ

| **Cost per Unit (Rs.)** | 26     | 26     | 26     | 26     | 26     | 26     |

#### New Plan
| Month        | March  | April  | May    | June   | July   | August |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Water**   | 6,800  | 7,480  | 8,228  | 9,053  | 9,962  | 10,965 |
| **Sugar Syrup** | 5,600  | 6,160  | 6,776  | 7,455  | 8,204  | 9,030  |
| **Flavoring** | 4,800  | 5,280  | 5,808  | 6,390  | 7,032  | 7,740  |

| **Cost per Unit (Rs.)** | 26     | 26     | 26     | 26     | 26     | 26     |

**Total Cost:** The total cost of raw material consumption is significantly higher in the New Plan compared to the Old Plan due to the increase in sales volume.

**Cost Per Unit:** Even though the total cost has increased, the cost per unit remains unchanged at ‚Çπ26.
- This indicates that the new plan does not impact the raw material cost structure but mainly increases due to higher production.

- The new plan increases raw material costs due to higher production, but since the cost per unit remains stable, profitability will depend on sales price adjustments and operational efficiencies. üìäüöÄ

### Contribution: Old Plan Vs New Plan
Contribution refers to the portion of revenue that remains after deducting variable costs. It represents the amount available to cover fixed costs and generate profit.

```Contribution = Sales Quantity - Variable Quantity```

```Contribution¬†per¬†Unit=Selling¬†Price¬†per¬†Unit‚àíVariable¬†Cost¬†per¬†Unit```

#### Some Important points about Contribution
- A higher contribution indicates better profitability.
- If the contribution is greater than fixed costs, the company makes a profit.
- If the contribution is equal to fixed costs, the company breaks even (no profit, no loss).
- If the contribution is less than fixed costs, the company incurs a loss.

   - March sales increased by **10.4%** (from **‚Çπ59,450K** to **‚Çπ65,600K**).  

2. **Higher Variable Costs in New Plan**  
   - The **New Plan** resulted in **higher raw material costs** and **bottling & processing costs**.  
   - Total Variable Cost in **August** increased by **42.8%** (from **‚Çπ31,992K** to **‚Çπ45,666K**).  

3. **Contribution Growth in New Plan**  
   - Despite higher costs, the **New Plan** still achieved higher **total contribution** every month.  
   - **June contribution increased** by **23.8%** (from **‚Çπ40,079K** to **‚Çπ49,629K**).  

4. **Lower Contribution per Unit in New Plan**  
   - The **New Plan** has a lower **Contribution per Unit (‚Çπ46.60)** compared to the **Old Plan (‚Çπ48.00)**.  
   - This suggests that while total profits are increasing, the profit **per unit is decreasing** due to **higher costs**.  

- The **New Plan** is more **profitable in absolute terms** but has **increased variable costs** leading to a **lower per-unit profit margin**. If costs continue to rise, long-term profitability may be affected.
