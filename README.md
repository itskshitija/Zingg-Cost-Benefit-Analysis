## 🔍Project Overview
The Cold Drink Station is a beverage company that sells cold drinks under the brand name 'Zingg'. For the upcoming summer season, they aim to appeal to young customers in India by marketing their brand during the World Cup. The marketing head is very excited about the brand launch, but the finance manager is a bit skeptical and has requested a cost-benefit report for the event. 

As a data analyst in the marketing department, you have been asked to prepare a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and present it through a dashboard to the marketing head.

The marketing team has decided to introduce a new bottle for Zingg, featuring World Cup-related images. This initiative will incur additional costs for a new mould and higher packaging expenses. The new bottle will replace the regular Zingg bottles for six months
